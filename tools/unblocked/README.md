# Unblocked qualification tools

This directory holds development-only fixtures and evidence for the CDP-first
migration. Its Python dependencies are isolated from every Rust production
package and binary.

## Frozen inputs

- `baseline.json` records the source, lockfiles, Rust toolchains, benchmark
  revision, platform environment, exact commands, and explicit
  passed/failed/skipped/not-run results for OB-001.
- `client-scope.json` records the official Playwright Python version, bundled
  driver and reference Chromium revision, connection boundary, and the
  required/deferred/unsupported API inventory for OB-025.
- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` pin the unmodified official client and all of
  its Python dependencies. They are not part of an Obscura build or release.

Validate the committed records with the system Python:

```bash
python3 tools/unblocked/validate.py baseline tools/unblocked/baseline.json
python3 tools/unblocked/validate.py client tools/unblocked/client-scope.json
python3 -m unittest tools.unblocked.tests.test_validate -v
```

Create the isolated client environment without resolving newer dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --project tools/unblocked --frozen --python 3.12
```

Playwright starts no Obscura process. A host starts `obscura serve`, then the
official client uses `BrowserType.connect_over_cdp`. `BrowserType.connect`
uses Playwright's own protocol and is outside the product boundary.
`APIRequestContext` and `Route.fetch` execute in the Playwright driver, so they
are not certified for protected traffic that must use Obscura's primp path.

The manifests report missing evidence rather than treating it as success. The
initial record still has Linux results marked not-run, so this foundation does
not close OB-001 or release gates.
